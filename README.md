This is a one-page website for a fictitious high-end estate agency.  The layout was made almost entirely with CSS Grid.  

This site was made as part of a Udemy course, 'Advanced CSS and SASS: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More', by Jonas Schmedtmann.  The course can be found here:  https://tinyurl.com/y6fb4rx8
